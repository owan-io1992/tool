# Code Style
- Use camelCase for variable names
- Constants (values that never change) should typically be named in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Avoid single-letter or vague names like `d` (for data), `temp`, or `i` (except for simple loop counters)
- Use Nouns or Noun Phrases for variables, classes, and files (e.g., shoppingCart, userName, orderProcessor)
- Use Verbs or Verb Phrases for functions and methods (e.g., calculateTotalAmount(), processPayment())
